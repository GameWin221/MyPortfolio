Check out all of my projects on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/GameWin221).

# - 2024 -
## [Gemino](https://github.com/GameWin221/Gemino)
Designed to be a high performance gpu-driven rendering framework with real-world applications in mind (e.g. games).

It's also my passion project for learning and experimenting with new graphics programming concepts.

Just a simple Particle Life simulation made in Rust.

I made this project after I got inspired by [this great video by Tom Mohr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4YirERTVF0).

## [OxiTrace](https://github.com/GameWin221/oxi-trace)
OxiTrace is a raytracer made with Rust and Ash (Vulkan API for rust)

# - 2022 -
## [Eruption Engine](https://github.com/GameWin221/Eruption-Engine)
My first attempt at making a rendering engine using Vulkan as its graphical API.
