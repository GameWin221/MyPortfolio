# *- 2024 -*
## [Resurrecting an RC Car](http://gamewin221.github.io/posts/ressurection_of_an_rc_car/)
![resurrected_rc](/images/rccar.png)
A fun idea I got after my dad had found my old (10+ years old) RC car. Turns out that [making an RC car almost from scratch](http://gamewin221.github.io/posts/ressurection_of_an_rc_car/) is not that hard...

## [Pico Game Console 2](https://github.com/GameWin221/PicoGameConsole)
![pico_game_console2](/images/picogameconsole2.png)
A much-improved version of the previous generation game console, now with a custom PCB. Still powered with Raspberry Pi Pico!

## [Gemino](https://github.com/GameWin221/Gemino)
![gemino](/images/EarlyGPUOcclusionCullingTests2.png)
Designed to be a high-performance GPU-driven rendering framework with real-world applications in mind (e.g. games).

It's also my passion project for learning and experimenting with new graphics programming concepts.

# *- 2023-*
## [Pico Game Console](https://github.com/GameWin221/PicoGameConsole)
![pico_game_console](/images/picogameconsole.png)
My game console powered by Raspberry Pi Pico and an ST7735 LCD display.

Particle Life simulation made in Rust.

I made this project after I got inspired by [this great video by Tom Mohr](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4YirERTVF0).

## [OxiTrace](https://github.com/GameWin221/oxi-trace)
![oxitrace](/images/oxitrace.png)
OxiTrace is a raytracer I made with Rust and Ash (Vulkan API for Rust). 

It's basically a partial implementation of the amazing tutorial: [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

# *- 2022 -*
## [Dice Fighter](https://gamewin221.itch.io/dice-fighter)
![dicefighter](/images/dicefighter.png)
An entry for the [GMTK Game Jam 2022](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-jam-2022). 1764th place in the "enjoyment" category, 2092nd place overall. I paired up with my friend for this project.

## [Eruption Engine](https://github.com/GameWin221/Eruption-Engine)
![eruption_engine](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72656547/182173442-0d863f3c-ef96-4ec9-ab1b-0ae1a62b3b4e.jpg)
My first attempt at making a rendering engine using Vulkan as its graphical API. Ended up as a wannabe-game-engine which I spent ***a lot*** of time on.

# *- 2021 -*
## [Just An Enginner](https://gamewin221.itch.io/just-an-engineer)
![justanengineer](/images/justanengineer.png)
An entry for the [Bored Pixels Game Jam 8](https://itch.io/jam/bored-pixels-jam-8). 32nd place in the "immersion" category, 56th place overall.

## [Ball's Journey: Into Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anwitch.ballsjourney)
![ballsjourney](/images/ballsjourney.png)
My own game I released on the Google Play store. One of my most polished projects.
