## Let me introduce myself
I'm a programmer passionate about graphics and gpu programming. I guess I'm just addicted to speed and performance...

On a daily basis I use C++. It's the language I'm the most experienced and comfortable with however I also really enjoy Rust.

Speaking of system languages I can also read and write basic x86/x64 assembly.
For other side-projects I use C#, Python, JS and LUA.

Besides making software I also make some small DIY and/or IOT projects. You can find them either in the posts or in the projects page.
